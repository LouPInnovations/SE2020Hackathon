      <h3>Welcome To,</h3>
      <h1>QUICK CODE</h1>
      <br><br><br>
      <h2>What is Quick Code?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Quick code is a quick and convenient tool to help you learn! Whether you are a beginner, experienced, or a pro at code, this tool is perfect for you. We believe that understanding how code works is key for being efficient at coding in the future. Quick Code easily delivers a concept of coding in many different languages and allows you to compare and understand how it works in a specific language. Apart from that, we have a quick and easy code converter, allowing you to quickly convert code from one language to another, boosting efficiency even more! Quick code makes for easy to understand and fast code on your computer.      </p>
      <br><br><br>
      <h2>How to use Quick Code</h2>
      <br>
      <p>To learn and compare concepts in different languages, please click on discover at the top of this page. It will list four different languages for you to potentially use. First, double click on the language you are familiar with and want to use to compare, and then click on a second language, which will be the new language you will try to learn. Then, click on the coding concept and click the button at the bottom to see the output. This service provides two different viewpoints of the same code, helping you reinforce the concept you already know but in a different language. In order to use our code converter, please navigate to the converter page by clicking on converter at the top bar.

      </p>
       <br><br><br>
       <h2>Code Converter</h2>
       <p>
The code converter is a simple yet effective tool when optimizing coding speed. You simply select a coding language, input what you want translated into other languages, then hit submit. The code will then magically be converted to the correct syntax for all of the other languages. All four languages with the correct syntax will be displayed, allowing the user to quickly take the translated code or use it to compare with their known language, which aligns with our belief that understanding the language will boost efficiency in the future! Note: Currently this converter will only work on taking print statements and assigning variables and will only be able to convert those two (e.g. int x = 5; and System.out.print(“test”);).
