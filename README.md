Hi! This is our project for the SE2020 Hackathon. Full website can be accessed through https://aadityayadav.github.io/SEhackathon2020/

During this hackaton I worked with many different languages (Python, Java, JS) as well as HTML and CSS. This is my first time doing web development and I think it went pretty well. More web dev to come in the future!
